      <h2>The Case for Businesses</h2>
      <p>Meaningful work is essential to human flourishing and to America’s promise of upward mobility and civic equality, while tapping the full talents of our people is essential for productive and inclusive economic growth. The gradual erosion of such work for many in the US economy over the past 30 years threatens both America’s promise and economic vitality.</p>
      <p>Every day that goes by without filling an open position costs a business $434 on average. This number is likely higher for IT jobs which take an average of 95 business days to fill - higher than the overall average. Committing to TechHire means access to an expanded hiring pool with qualified candidates who are ready to work, but may have previously been overlooked.</p>

        <h2>MasterCard Case Study</h2>
        <p>Mastercard began working with LaunchCode in the spring of 2014. Mastercard started with one apprentice developer. That developer got a job coming out of their apprenticeship. Growing out of the successful apprenticeship, Mastercard decided to start a larger pilot in the fall of 2014. At this time they took 3 additional apprentices in software engineering, project management, and development. One of these apprentices was LaShana Lewis, whose story of grit and hard work was later highlighted by President Obama.</p>

        <h2>SAIC Case Study</h2>
        <p>SAIC approached LaunchCode to help fill their talent needs. So far, it has been a great success. They have hired and converted three LaunchCode apprentices in the past year, including Lee Wissmiller, a US Marine veteran, who was diagnosed with narcolepsy ten years ago. Lee is a skilled programmer, but due to his disability, was unable to find a permanent job despite attending 285 job interviews. After discovering LaunchCode, Lee was placed at SAIC where he successfully transitioned to a full-time position as a software developer. <a href="#">See SAIC and Lee’s story here.</a></p>
