    <h3>The Case for Businesses</h3>
    <p>
      Meaningful work is essential to human flourishing and to America’s
      promise of upward mobility and civic equality, while tapping the
      full talents of our people is essential for productive and inclusive
      economic growth. The gradual erosion of such work for many in the US
      economy over the past 30 years threatens both America’s promise and
      economic vitality.

    <h3>MasterCard Case Study</h3>
    <p>
      Mastercard began working with LaunchCode in the spring of 2014.
      Mastercard started with one apprentice developer. That developer
      got a job coming out of their apprenticeship. Growing out of the
      successful apprenticeship, Mastercard decided to start a larger
      pilot in the fall of 2014. At this time they took 3 additional
      apprentices in software engineering, project management, and
      development. One of these apprentices was LaShana Lewis, whose
      story of grit and hard work was later highlighted by President Obama.

    <h3>SAIC Case Study</h3>
    <p>
      SAIC approached LaunchCode to help fill their talent needs.
      So far, it has been a great success. They have hired and converted
      three LaunchCode apprentices in the past year, including Lee
      Wissmiller, a US Marine veteran, who was diagnosed with narcolepsy
      ten years ago. Lee is a skilled programmer, but due to his
      disability, was unable to find a permanent job despite attending
      285 job interviews. After discovering LaunchCode, Lee was placed
      at SAIC where he successfully transitioned to a full-time position
      as a software developer. See SAIC and Lee’s story here.
